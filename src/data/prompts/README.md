# Prompt Engineering & Super Traits

All prompts for the AI assistant must begin with the `prompt_header.md` preamble, which sets the tone, focus, and super traits for every interaction.

## How to Use
- Copy the contents of `prompt_header.md` to the top of every new prompt template.
- Use the provided prompt templates for onboarding, vendor commands, contract negotiation, dispute resolution, and more.
- Always explain reasoning, suggest improvements, and consider long-term, ethical, and user-centric impacts.

## Templates
- onboarding_en.md
- onboarding_fr.md
- assistant_vendor_commands.md
- assistant_contract_negotiation.md
- assistant_dispute_resolution.md

## Best Practices
- Be transparent, pedagogical, and context-aware.
- Challenge assumptions, anticipate future needs, and prioritize security.
- Use a confident, friendly, and instructive tone.
- Adapt advice to the userâ€™s expertise and project context.
