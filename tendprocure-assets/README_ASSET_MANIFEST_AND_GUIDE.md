# Infographic Design Guidelines
- Use TendProcure brand colors: navy (#1B2E4B), cyan (#2DD4BF), slate (#64748B), white, and soft gradients.
- Use clear, modern icons (line + filled style, consistent weight).
- All text should be legible at small sizes; use Open Sans or Roboto.
- Add call-to-action or summary at the bottom of each infographic.
- Export at 2x for retina screens (SVG preferred for diagrams).

# Automation & Embedding
- Place all final assets in `/tendprocure-assets/` subfolders.
- Use React components to auto-load and display infographics/videos by mapping asset filenames to feature sections.
- For videos, use `<video src={require('...')} controls />` or dynamic import for lazy loading.
- For infographics, use `<img src={require('...')} alt="..." />` with responsive styling.
- Add a script to scan `/tendprocure-assets/` and auto-generate an asset manifest for the app.
- Document all asset usage and update README with integration instructions.

# Next Steps
1. Design and export all enhanced infographics (see checklist above).
2. Produce/export all videos using Pictory/FlexClip with the provided scripts/storyboards.
3. Place all assets in `/tendprocure-assets/` and verify file names.
4. Update React components to auto-load and display assets in the correct sections.
5. Add asset manifest script and document usage.
6. Review all content for brand consistency, accessibility, and UX.
7. Announce launch with a blog post and social banners.
