Removed unnecessary files for professional project hygiene:
- bundle-analysis.html (only needed for local analysis)
- components.json (not referenced anywhere)
- test-supabase-connection.js (compiled artifact, .ts and .cjs are used in CI)
- .env.sentry-build-plugin (ignored and not used)

If you need to restore any, check git history.
